# NYTimes_Variations
Using the New York Time resources (API, corpus...) in various settings

WORK IN PROGRESS

## Trending or not Trending

*Resource:* New York Times API


This project is the result of my participation in a DLab (http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) workshop  "Extracting Data through Web APIs in Python" led by Rochelle Terman.


* **Global Picture:** Is the subject of "Donald Trump" trending? This interactive bar chart will allow you to explore the evolution of the popularity of your chosen search word over a certain time frame.

* **Technical Milestones:** The popularity of a search term is defined as the number of articles published on the subject in the New York Times. Goals: i) query the New York Times API, ii) set up a reporting tool (interactive bar chart), iii) develop a user-friendly way of showing corresponding keywords (wordclouds)

* **Teaching Aim:** read the **Follow_Along.md** markdown to have a step-by-step built-up of the simple script **NYT_api.py**
