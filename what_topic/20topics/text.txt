<p id="doc0">I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw
the other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/
early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,
the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is 
all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years
of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you
have on this funky looking car, please e-mail.</p>

<p id="doc10">I have a line on a Ducati 900GTS 1978 model with 17k on the clock.  Runs
very well, paint is the bronze/brown/orange faded out, leaks a bit of oil
and pops out of 1st with hard accel.  The shop will fix trans and oil 
leak.  They sold the bike to the 1 and only owner.  They want $3495, and
I am thinking more like $3K.  Any opinions out there?  Please email me.
Thanks.  It would be a nice stable mate to the Beemer.  Then I'll get
a jap bike and call myself Axis Motors!

I first read and consulted rec.guns in the summer of 1991.  I
just purchased my first firearm in early March of this year.</p>

I was at a Cincinnati Cyclones game a year ago when the local country
station sponsored a kazoo giveaway.  After a particularly bad call by the
underexperienced ECHL ref, it was Kazoostorm time down on the ice.  I
thought this was a pathetic display by the fans, but they were rightfully
unhappy.</p>

<p id="doc1000">Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver?
Sorry, don't know the version of the driver (no indication in the menus) but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system.  Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this.

post or email</p>
